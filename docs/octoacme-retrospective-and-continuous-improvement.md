# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Action Item Follow-Up Process
Action items from retrospectives must be tracked to completion to drive real improvement.

### Follow-Up Mechanisms
- **Automatic Reminders**: Set calendar reminders for action item due dates
- **Weekly Review**: Dedicate 5-10 minutes in weekly PM sync to review open action items
- **Owner Pings**: PM sends reminder to action item owner 3 days before due date
- **Retrospective Check-In**: Start each retrospective by reviewing status of previous action items
- **Accountability Board**: Maintain a visible dashboard of action item status (e.g., GitHub project board)

### Action Item Lifecycle
1. **Created**: Defined in retrospective with owner, due date, and success criteria
2. **In Progress**: Owner actively working on the action
3. **Blocked**: Owner has identified a blocker; escalate for help
4. **Completed**: Success criteria met; document outcome
5. **Closed**: Verified complete or explicitly decided not to pursue (with rationale)

### Ensuring Closure
- Action items not started within 2 weeks are flagged for re-prioritization or cancellation
- Items blocked for >1 week are escalated to PM and Product Lead
- Completed items must include evidence/documentation before closing
- Abandoned items require documented reason (deprioritized, no longer relevant, etc.)

## Documenting & Measuring Improvements
Track completed improvements to demonstrate ROI and build continuous improvement culture.

### Completed Improvement Tracker
Use the [Completed Action Item Tracker](completed-action-item-tracker.md) template to document:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Who implemented it
- When it was completed
- How impact was measured
- Results achieved

### Example Completed Improvement
| Action Item | Owner | Completed | Problem Addressed | Solution Implemented | Impact Measured | Results |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Reduce PR review time | Dev Team | 2026-01-15 | PRs waiting 2-3 days for review, slowing delivery | Implemented PR rotation schedule and size guidelines | Average review time | Reduced from 2.5 days to 8 hours |
| Improve incident response | DevOps | 2026-01-10 | Confusion during incidents, delayed MTTR | Created runbook and practiced tabletop exercise | Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) | Reduced from 45min to 20min |

### Measuring Impact
Define success metrics when creating action items:
- **Efficiency**: Time saved, reduced cycle time, faster feedback
- **Quality**: Fewer bugs, reduced incidents, improved test coverage
- **Team Health**: Higher satisfaction scores, reduced burnout indicators
- **Customer Satisfaction**: NPS improvements, reduced support tickets
- **Business Outcomes**: Faster time-to-market, increased feature velocity

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
