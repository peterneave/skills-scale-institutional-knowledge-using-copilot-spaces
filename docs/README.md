# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This guide provides an overview of how OctoAcme runs projects and serves as an entry point for team members and contributors to understand our standard processes.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme uses a lightweight, iterative approach to project management that prioritizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our methodology is built on core principles of customer-first delivery, measurable goals, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety.

### How We Run Projects

**Project Initiation** begins with validating the business need and creating a Project One-pager that defines the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial timeline. This phase ensures alignment before committing resources and concludes with a go/no-go decision to move into planning.

**Project Planning** transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs. The team conducts a kickoff meeting, breaks work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria, estimates effort, and creates a release plan. Dependencies and risks are identified early and tracked in a Risk Register. A Definition of Done ensures quality standards are understood by all.

**Execution and Tracking** follows an agile rhythm with daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and sprint demos. Teams use project boards to visualize workflow, manage pull requests with automated testing, and maintain quality through unit tests, integration tests, and security scanning. Progress is tracked through velocity metrics and dashboards, with a clear escalation path for blockers.

**Risk Management and Communication** are integrated throughout the project lifecycle. Risks are continuously identified, assessed, mitigated, and monitored. Stakeholders receive regular updates using standardized communication templates, ensuring transparency and alignment across the organization.

**Release and Deployment** follows a structured process that includes pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, and rollback plans. All releases require passing CI/security scans, documented release notes, and post-deploy verification. The team maintains incident response procedures for rapid issue resolution.

**Retrospectives and Continuous Improvement** occur after each sprint, release, or milestone. Teams reflect on what went well and what could be improved, then commit to 2-3 prioritized action items with clear owners and timelines. This learning culture ensures processes evolve based on real experience.

### Core Roles

Projects are delivered by cross-functional teams with clearly defined responsibilities:

- **Project Managers (PM)** coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules and risks, and facilitate team communication
- **Product Managers (PdM)** define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success against customer value
- **Developers** implement features, maintain quality through testing and code review, and collaborate on technical design
- **QA/Testing** validate acceptance criteria and ensure quality standards are met
- **Stakeholders** provide input, approvals, and support throughout the project lifecycle

### Key Artifacts

OctoAcme projects rely on these standard artifacts to maintain clarity and alignment:

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Release Notes
- Retrospective Notes and Action Items
