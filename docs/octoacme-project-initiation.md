# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)

## Stakeholder Engagement
Stakeholders play a critical role throughout the project lifecycle. Clear expectations help ensure smooth collaboration.

### Stakeholder Roles & Expectations
- **Sponsors**: Provide strategic direction, approve scope changes, remove organizational blockers
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**: Offer domain expertise during planning and validation phases
- **End Users/Customers**: Participate in discovery, provide feedback on prototypes and demos
- **Adjacent Teams**: Coordinate on dependencies, integrations, and shared resources
- **Leadership**: Receive status updates, provide guidance on trade-offs and priorities

### Engagement During Project Phases
- **Initiation**: Align on problem statement, goals, and success criteria; confirm commitment
- **Planning**: Review and validate scope, provide input on priorities and constraints
- **Execution**: Participate in demos, provide timely feedback, approve acceptance criteria
- - **Release**: Review release notes, coordinate go-live timing, support launch activities
- **Retrospective**: Share feedback on collaboration effectiveness

### Stakeholder Feedback Channels
Establish clear channels early to enable ongoing communication:
- Dedicated Slack/Teams channel for project updates and questions
- Regular survey cadence (e.g., after major milestones or monthly)
- Office hours or open Q&A sessions for stakeholder input
- Demo sessions with structured feedback collection
- Async feedback forms for written input on designs/specs
